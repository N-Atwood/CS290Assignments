		<h2>2021.04.12 - Assignment #1 Post</h2>
		<p>This assignment was my first time writing anything in html, so everything I used for it was a learning experience. Surprisingly, adding an image at the end was one of the harder parts. I initially tried saving the image to my computer, but I seem to be misunderstanding something about using an image located in a different file and ultimately I just used an image link instead. Next time it comes up I'll probably save the image in the folder I'm using to streamline things, as MobaXTerm doesn't allow pasting (or if so, doesn't allow it with ctrl+v). Mozilla's "Intro to HTML" resource was incredibly helpful, although I didn't need as much help as I expected. Despite never having used HTML in the past, the format is <em>very</em> similar to the format used in a lot of forums I frequented in high school, so the majority of what I'm referring to is just the specific differences (like using "em" instead of "i," at least for default formatting). Overall I think this was a good way to become comfortable using html and I'm excited to tackle more involved assignments in the future.</p>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> I should learn how to get html mark-ups to show as plaintext in angled brackets instead of performing their operation for future blog posts, as it could help to be able to show examples of html.</p>
