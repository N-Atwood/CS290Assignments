                <h2>2021.05.10 - Assignment #3 Post</h2>
		<p>In this aassignment, I wrote javascript to enable functionality of features which already had html and css written up. One of the biggest issues I personally had was figuring out how to deal with javascript's loosely typed nature. There were points where I wasn't certain whether I was dealing with the original data (via a pointer) or a copy (via a local variable). Additionally, there was a fairly long period of time where I was attempting to force an empty nodeList to exist so I could use nodeList properties without needing to initialize (I later realized that using an empty div and referring to child nodes would make more sense). Ultimately, the loose typing was dealt with through trial and error, and I now have a better understanding of how different data can be handled.</p>

		<p>The single most useful resource was again Mozilla, although codestack was also helpful. In the case of codestack, while I generally went to a post where someone asked the same question I wanted an answer to, what wound up helping was typically seeing their example code and realizing I had something completely mixed up (e.g., typing "toLowerCase(element)" instead of "element.toLowerCase()"). Overall, this assignment was much easier for me due to being a step removed from UI and I didn't need to consult online resources nearly as much as with the previous assignment.</p>

		<p>I do still need to take more notes, and better notes. The portions of this assignment where I was able to consult my own notes definitely wound up going more smoothly than the parts where I consulted any online resource.</p>

		<p>This assignment was really interesting, and I definitely should have started it a couple of days before I did. Working with CSS introduces a lot of new things to consider, and it's going to take some time to remember which html elements can use which CSS properties. Ultimately the things I worried the most about, such as coding the new post button, were extremely easy, while elements I thought would be easier turned out to present major issues. Probably a full hour of this assignment was spent getting the search bar over to the right before I finally realized position: absolute would fix the problem (I forgot that for nested elements absolute refers to the parent and not to the viewport). I was able to limit the flexbox to 3 elements per row, and to centre the flexbox, but I wasn't able to do both at the same time and ultimately opted to have it centred. In retrospect, I believe I could have referenced the device's size (rather than the viewport's) and done it. I'll have to give that a shot just to see if I can make work.
		My biggest takeaway from this is that I need to be taking better notes in lecture, because some of the information I needed to look up was definitely gone over in class. The most helpful site was definitely Mozilla, and W3Schools was helpful as well. I definitely need to go over my code again tomorrow, because doing assignments at the last minute doesn't really help with retention in my experience. I'm finally starting a new dosage on my ADHD meds which will make it much easier to start future assignments at a reasonable time.</p>

		<h2>2021.04.12 - Assignment #1 Post</h2>
		<p>This assignment was my first time writing anything in html, so everything I used for it was a learning experience. Surprisingly, adding an image at the end was one of the harder parts. I initially tried saving the image to my computer, but I seem to be misunderstanding something about using an image located in a different file and ultimately I just used an image link instead. Next time it comes up I'll probably save the image in the folder I'm using to streamline things, as MobaXTerm doesn't allow pasting (or if so, doesn't allow it with ctrl+v). Mozilla's "Intro to HTML" resource was incredibly helpful, although I didn't need as much help as I expected. Despite never having used HTML in the past, the format is <em>very</em> similar to the format used in a lot of forums I frequented in high school, so the majority of what I'm referring to is just the specific differences (like using "em" instead of "i," at least for default formatting). Overall I think this was a good way to become comfortable using html and I'm excited to tackle more involved assignments in the future.</p>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> I should learn how to get html mark-ups to show as plaintext in angled brackets instead of performing their operation for future blog posts, as it could help to be able to show examples of html.</p>
