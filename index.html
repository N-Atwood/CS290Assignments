		<h2>Questions/Answers</h2>
		<h3>What is the most complex or interesting thing you've done with your current web development skills?</h3>
		<p>I have had no web development experience before this course.</p>
		<h3>What do you hope to learn from this class?</h3>
		<p>Learning about what features help to create more accessible websites is definitely a goal. I don't intend to do web development in any professional context, but I definitely want to be sure any personal projects I publish are accessible.</p>
		<h3>Have you signed up for our course Piazza forum?</h3>
		<p>No, and I'm hoping this question is leftover from a previous term. I am signed up for the class CampusWire, which is described as having a Piazza-like forum, so it seems reasonable we would only have one of those.</p>
		<h3>What is the most interesting fact or unique personal experience about yourself you can recall?</h3>
		<p>When I was a little kid, I was once applauded by a packed restaurant in Disneyland after I finished assembling a sandwich. It was a kid's meal where you're provided with two slices of bread and a bunch of different toppings so you can make your own sandwich, and I was committed to using everything available. It probably took half an hour just because of the amount of time I spent meticulously placing and readjusting individual raisins, and apparently just about everyone with line of sight was watching me by the end. It was very startling.</p>
